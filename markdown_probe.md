### What *is* Markdown?
Markdown is, without blundering into too much technical details, a text-to-html conversion tool and simplified markup-language, meaning that it is a way to write text in an easy read- and write-able way, which then can be converted into nicely looking html to publish it on the web.
### The history of Markdown
#### Thoughts by John Gruber in the *Gruber Manifesto*

| ![John Gruber](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/64/John_Gruber%2C_2009_%28cropped%29.jpg "John Gruber") | John Gruber published version 1.0.1 of Markdown in December 2004, there has been no updated version ever since. In a [blogpost](https://daringfireball.net/2004/03/dive_into_markdown) from March 19, 2004, Gruber wrote about his thoughts and motivation to develop Markdown. This blogpost was later called the *Gruber Manifesto* by his colleague Aaron Swartz. In his manifesto, Gruber said that although html was easy, it was Although HTML is easy, it is repetitive, and time consuming (previews and stuff), and the raw format is not easily readable. Markdown has a different approach: John Gruber said that it is more like writing an email (it is his favourite medium), you don‘t have to preview an email, you just write it. 
Markdown is aimed at a gap between making it easy to use real HTML when you need it, and on the other hand just writing plain text when it is sensible and obvious to do so getting rid of tags → more intuitive designed as a preprocessor for HTML no need to escape tags when writing about code1 HTML is for publication, markdown is for reading and writing... |
